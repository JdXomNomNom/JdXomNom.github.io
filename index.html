        It is I. This is a web page. I own a web page. Well, github owns it. But I control it! Muahahaha!
      </p>
      <p> This branch would like to add this line here. </p>
      <p> However, this branch wants to add this text! How do we allow them both? </p>
      <br>
      <p> It appears the solution was to go in and manually fix the conflictions. This is really nice! I like github more now. </p>
      <p> Next I wanted to make a nav bar for future endeavors. So I did that. </p>
      <p> Using w3schools, I learnt that you needed to use an unordered list. </p>
